- Very good modularity on separating the components and pages as well as following the wireframe
- Switched files from JS to Typescript allows us to do typing for variables and components (easier for troubleshooting future bugs and code consistency)
- Added Example creating button widgets
- Included some documentation for installing extra things

## Next weeks tasks 10-27 to 11-3
